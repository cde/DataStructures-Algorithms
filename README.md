###### **Data Structures & Algorithms**

The idea behind this repo is to review concepts of Data Structures and some algorithms, baby steps :). 

Since it's a baby steps approach :P, some developers would find this boring, but it's a good refresher while
exploring other languages. Please be respectful if leaving comments or suggestions.   

It's a collection from tutorials/talks I've found useful. 

I divided by languages, and within each folder you would find:
- **algo-** < name > for algorithms for example **algo-dp** for dynamic problem examples. 
- **ds-** < name > for data structures, for example **ds-arrays** for array problem's examples.

**Note**
It's not a one-to-one exercise per language.
